    <string name="chapter1_lesson_numbers">Numbers</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_numbers_part0">In this chapter, we will learn about the basic data
        types available in Kotlin programming language.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_numbers_part1">The representation of numbers in Kotlin is pretty similar to Java,
         however, Kotlin does not allow internal conversion of different data types.
        The following table lists different variable lengths for different numbers.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_numbers_part2_1">In the following example, we will see how Kotlin
        works with different data types.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_numbers_part2_2">When you run the piece of code as shown previously,
        it will generate the following output.</string>

    <string name="chapter1_lesson_characters">Characters</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_characters_part1">Kotlin represents character using char.
        A character should be declared in a single quote like \'c\'.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_characters_part2">When you run the piece of code as shown previously,
        it will generate the following output.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_boolean_part1">Boolean is very simple like other programming languages.
    We have only two values for Boolean - either true or false. In the following example, we will save how
    Kotlin interprets Boolean.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_boolean_part2"> The above piece of code will yield the following output in the browser. </string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_string_part1">Strings are character arrays. Like Java, they are immutable in nature.
        We have two kinds of string available in Kotlin - one is called <b>raw String</b> and another is called <b>escaped String</b>.
        In the following example, we will make use of these strings.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_string_part2">The above example of escaped String allows to provide extra line space after the first print statement.
        Following will be the output in the browser.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_arrays_part1">Arrays are a collection of homogeneous data. Like Java, Kotlin supports arrays of different data types.
        In the following example, we will make use of different arrays.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_arrays_part2">The above piece of code yields the following output. The indexing of the array is similar to other programming languages.
        Here, we are searching for a second index, whose value is “3”.</string>

    <string name="chapter2_quiz_1">What is the equivalent of Java\'s \"int x = a ? b :c;\" in Kotlin?</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_1_a">val x = a ? b : c</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_1_b">val x = a ?: b, c</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_1_c">val x = if (a) b else c</string> <!-- Answer-->
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_1_d">None of the above</string>

    <string name="chapter2_quiz_2">What is the equivalent keyword of a <b>when</b>
        statement in other programming languages?</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_2_a">if</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_2_b">for</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_2_c">while</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_2_d">switch</string> <!-- Answer-->

    <string name="chapter2_quiz_3">What kind of a programming language is kotlin?</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_3_a">Functional</string> <!-- Answer-->
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_3_b">Procedural</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_3_c">Object-Oriented</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_3_d">Declarative</string>

    <string name="chapter2_quiz_4">Which of the following statements results in an output \"12345\",
        given that x is initialized to 0?</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_4_a">while(x++!=5) {print(x)}</string> <!-- Answer-->
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_4_b">for(i in 1..5) {print(x)}</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_4_c">do {print(x++) while(x!=5)}</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_4_d">None of the above</string>

    <string name="chapter2_quiz_5">Which of the following is true?</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_5_a">If \"when\" is used as an expression, the \"else\" branch is
        not mandatory.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_5_b">The \"else\"  branch will always be evaluated when the \"when\"
        expression is used</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_5_c">In a do-while loop the condition will always be tested at the end
        of the loop</string>
    <string name="chapter2_quiz_5_d">None of the above</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_ifelse">If-Else</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_ifelse_part1">In the previous chapter we have learned about
        different types of data types available in Kotlin system. In this chapter, we will discuss
        different types of control flow mechanism available in the Kotlin.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_ifelse_part2">Kotlin is a functional language hence like every
        functional language in Kotlin “if” is an expression and not a keyword. The expression \"if\"
        will return a value whenever necessary. Like other programming language. In the following
        example, we will compare two variables and provide the required output accordingly.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_ifelse_part3">The previous piece of code yields the following output
        as a result. The example also contains another line of code, which depicts
        how to use \"If\" statement as an expression.</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_when">When Statement</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_when_part1">If you are familiar with other programming languages,
        then you might have heard of the term switch statement, which is basically a conditional
        operator when multiple conditions can be applied on a particular variable. \"when\" operator
        matches the variable value against the branch conditions. If it is satisfying the branch
        condition then it will execute the statement inside that scope. In the following example,
        we will learn more about \"when\" in Kotlin.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_when_part2">The above piece of code yields the following output</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_when_part3">In the previous example, the Kotlin compiler matches the value
        of x with the given branches. If it is not matching any of the branches, then it will execute
        the else part. Practically, when is equivalent to multiple if blocks. Kotlin provides another
        flexibility to the developer, where the developer can provide multiple checks in the same line
        by providing \",\" inside the checks as follows.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_when_part4">Running the above piece of code would yield the following output</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_forloop">For Loop</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_forloop_part1">Loop is a statement that provides the flexibility
        to iterate through any kind of data structure. Like other programming languages, Kotlin also
        provides many kinds of Looping methodology, however, among them \"<b>For</b>\" is the most
        common one. The implementation and use of a "For" loop is conceptually similar to Java for loop.
        The following example shows how for loops can be used.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_forloop_part2">In the above piece of code, we have declared a list
        called "items" and using the for loop we are iterating through that defined list and printing
        its value with the output as shown below.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_forloop_part3">The following is another example of using for loops</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_forloop_part4">Once we compile and execute the above piece of code,
        it will yield the following output.</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_whileloop">While Loop and Do-While Loop</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_whileloop_part1">While and Do-While loops work in a similar way
        like they do in other programming languages. The following example shows the usage of
        the <b>While loop</b>.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_whileloop_part2">The previous piece of code yields the following output</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_whileloop_part3">Kotlin also has another loop called the Do-While loop,
        where the loop body will be executed once, and only then will the condition be checked.
        The following example shows the usage of the Do-while loop.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_whileloop_part4">The previous piece of code yields the following output.
        In the above code, the Kotlin compiler will execute the <b>DO</b> block, followed by condition
        checking in the while block.</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_return">Return</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_return_part1">Return is a keyword that returns some value to the
        calling function from the called function.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_return_part2">In the above piece of code, we are calling another 
        function and multiplying the input with 2, and returning the resultant value to the called 
        function that is our main function.</string>

    <string name="chapter2_lesson_contbreak">Continue &amp; Break</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_contbreak_part1">In Kotlin, the \"break\" keyword terminates the
        controller flow if some condition fails and \"continue\" does the opposite.
        Labels can also be applied as shown below.</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_contbreak_part2">The previous piece of code yields the following output</string>
    <string name="chapter2_lesson_contbreak_part3">As you can see, the controller continues the loop,
        until the value of x is 5. Once the value of x reaches 5, it starts executing the if block
        and once the break statement is reached, the entire control flow terminates the program execution.</string>

    <string name="chapter1_lesson_collections_part1"> Collection is a very important part of the data structure, which makes the software development easy for engineers.
        Kotlin has two types of collection - one is immutable collection (which means lists, maps and sets that cannot be editable) and another is mutable collection (this type of collection is editable). It is very important to keep in mind the type of collection used in your application, as Kotlin system does not represent any specific difference in them.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_collections_part2">The above piece of code will yield the following output in the browser.
        It gives an error when we try to clear the mutable list of collection.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_collections_part3">In collection, Kotlin provides some useful methods such as first(), last(), filter(), etc. All these methods are self-descriptive and easy to implement. Moreover, Kotlin follows the same structure such as Java while implementing collection.
        You are free to implement any collection of your choice such as Map and Set.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_collections_part4">In the following example, we have implemented Map and Set using different built-in methods.</string>
    <string name="chapter1_lesson_collections_part5">The above piece of code yields the following output in the browser.</string>
